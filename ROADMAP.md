## 🎉 Ready to Start?

**Recommended Starting Point**: Phase 1.1 - AI Model Integration

This will give you the biggest "wow factor" and differentiate your tool from basic stock analysis applications. The multi-model consensus engine is already built - we just need to activate it with API keys and chart generation!

Would you like to begin with setting up the AI integration or would you prefer to start with dashboard enhancements?
